# JavaNotes
Notes taken while studying [CSCI-605 Advanced Object-Oriented Programming Concepts](http://spiegel.cs.rit.edu/~hpb/Lectures/2181/605/index.html).

These are just notes an observations which I found interesting or useful. There are links to the course page which is open in any case.

I hope someone finds it useful.
(This should've been just a gist but I'll keep it around in case I update it)
